# Techideate-19
The final Hackathon of the year organised by MUJ ACM SCHAP to bring together a large number of young developers and programmers. They use 24 hours to make something innovative and out of the box using a cool stack of technologies. Learning team and time management and brainstorming under time constraints which only lets the participants make a prototype.
